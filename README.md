Creating short promotional clips from BRUV imagery annotated in Eventment Measure for Seamap Australia
Written by jacquomo.monk@utas.edu.au and Justin.Hulls@utas.edu.au

This code assumes you have a folder containing all video files in a directory called "Converted". It also requires the following database export files from EventMeasure: "\\Points.txt","\\3DPoints.txt" and "\\Period.txt" and one "\\Metadata.csv" file that is structured based on GlobalArchive standards found in the CheckEM user guide https://marine-ecology.shinyapps.io/CheckEM/

This repo contains three code files that produce consistently formated video clips and metadata to allow upload into Seamap Australia:
- highlight_clips extracts video snippets for highlight events tagged using "Attribute 9" and short (<50 characters) plain text description in "Comment" attribute in EventMeasure exports (requires "\\Metadata.csv" and "\\3DPoints.txt")
- maxn_clips extracts video snippets at MaxN events based on EventMeasure exports  (requires "\\Metadata.csv" and "\\Points.txt")
- representative_clips extracts representative video snippets based on EventMeasure exports  (requires "\\Metadata.csv" and "\\Period.txt")

Once exported, use this token to transfer videos for ingestion into Seamap Australia: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/l666jkpkvu4mv9ha3bgs4/AHmNvZiwVpzRAY8mC_-Iuug?rlkey=okjgls12zd4tgnlcyyg8szk6r&st=qb852lh4&dl=0
