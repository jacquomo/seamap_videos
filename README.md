Written by jacquomo.monk@utas.edu.au and Justin.Hulls@utas.edu.au

This code assumes you have a folder containing all video files in a directory called "Converted". It also requires the following databased export files from EventMeasure: "\\Points.txt","\\3DPoints.txt" and "\\Period.txt" and one "\\Metadata.csv" file that is structured based on GlobalArchive standards found in the CheckEM user guide https://marine-ecology.shinyapps.io/CheckEM/
